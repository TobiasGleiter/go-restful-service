# RESTful web service API with Go and the Gin Web Framework (Gin)

This Project is to use Go for building a RESTful web service API to learn Go. I followed the official [Go.dev tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin)

## Prequestries

- Go 1.16 or later
- Codeeditor
- Terminal (Max)/Cmd (Windows)

## Steps:

1. Design API endpoints.

## Design API endpoints

### /albums

- _GET_ – Get a list of all albums, returned as JSON.
- _POST_ – Add a new album from request data sent as JSON.

### /albums/:id

- _GET_ – Get an album by its ID, returning the album data as JSON.
